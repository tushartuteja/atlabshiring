# Atlabs is Hiring Software Engineers & Video Editors

Let's be real â€“ AI promises the world, but creative professionals are stuck with scattered tools that lack **granular creative control** and **integrated workflow** needed for serious video production. Video creation demands speed, cost-efficiency, and _precise_ creative oversight, yet the path from concept to final cut remains painful.

That's why we started Atlabs.

## Our Mission

We're building the future of video production â€“ a platform where creative professionals can turn ideas into storyboards, ads, trailers, full-length feature films without sacrificing control. By automating the complex workflow from storyboard through post-production, we compress timelines from months to days and dramatically lower costs.

But the real magic lies in iteration. Atlabs unlocks the ability to test hundreds of variations â€“ different actors, worlds, voices, narratives â€“ with ease. We see AI not as a replacement for creativity, but as a powerful catalyst, removing tedious constraints and allowing studios, brands, and agencies to finally produce content at the speed of imagination. With custom AI models ensuring brand consistency, Atlabs helps you discover what truly connects with your audience.

This isn't just another "hit generate and pray" tool. We're building an AI-first video creation suite that puts creators firmly in the driver's seat.

## What You'll Work On

- **R&D** - AI agents, custom model training, and cutting-edge experiments.
- **Infra and Scale: AI pipeline** that powers workflows that require 600-800 LLM calls and 200 GPU calls in under a minute for a single storyboard.
- A **video editor** in the browser â€” real-time, intelligent, creative and fast.

## Who We're Looking For

### 1. Full Stack Developers (0-2, 2-4 years experience)

You understand frontend, backend and database well. If I point you to a button, you can instantly tell that this will trigger an API call, triggering an async process, and the user will get a confirmation through sockets.

### 2. Frontend Developers (0-2, 2-4 years experience)

You're a React Ninja, understand the in and out of DOM and how browser events work. You obsess over getting the job done for the user in the minimum number of clicks and keyboard bindings.

- You should love **product development and enjoy seeing users use your product. You should obsess over user experience (UX) and performance. Our users spend as much** as 8 hours a day on the platform.

- Understanding of pacing, visual composition, and emotional storytelling techniques
- Willingness to experiment with new technologies while maintaining high production standards

You'll help shape our AI tools to meet real filmmaking needs, translating creative intent into technical requirements and ensuring our platform delivers professional-quality results.
